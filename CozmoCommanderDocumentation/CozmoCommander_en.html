<h1>CozmoCommander</h1>
<p>Use the Anki Cozmo robot with a GUI. Uses Python with TkInter.</p>

<p>I am new to Cozmo, new to GUI programming and still new to Python. <br>
So this project is definitely not programmed in the most efficient or most elegant way. <br>
At the beginning I only wanted to find out how the world coordinate system works. <br>
By and by, the program got bigger and it is still growing. The "todo" grows faster that the "done" list. </p>

<a name = "What it does"></a><<h2>What it does:</h2>
<p>CozmoCommander opens a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with optional viewers provided by the Cozmo SDK. <br>
You can control the Cozmo robot and its interaction with lightcubes and other objects. <br>
You can open a 2D map where the position of the robot is tracked and other objects are shown. <br>
You can create virtual objects in the 2D map and send Cozmo to a location by doubleclicking on the map. </p>

<!-- ------------------- -->
<a name = "Prerequisites"></a><h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
<ul><li>You need a Cozmo robot,</li> 
<li>an Android (or IOS?) device connected to the computer via USB.</li>
<li>the Cozmo App,</li>
<li>a computer running Linux (Ubuntu) or Windows,</li>
<li>Python3,</li>
<li>Cozmo SDK and other Python libraries as requested,   </li>
<li>Optionally: freeglut to use the 3D viewer.</li></ul>

<p>Refer to the SDK documentation for setting up your device
<a href="https://developer.anki.com/blog/learn/tutorial/getting-started-with-the-cozmo-sdk/" target="NewWindow">https://developer.anki.com/blog/learn/tutorial/getting-started-with-the-cozmo-sdk/</a></p>

<!-- ------------------- -->
<a name = "How to start CozmoCommander"></a><h2></a>How to start CozmoCommander:</h2>
<ul><li>Connect your device to the Cozmo via WiFi and to the computer via USB cable. </li>
<li>On the device, start the Cozmo App, connect to Cozmo and enter SDK mode. </li>
<li>Place Cozmo on the charger (again). </li></ul>

<p>From the command line (Linux and Windows), enter <br>
<code>python3 [path to CozmoCommander]CozmoCommander.py [--arguments]</code><br>
or under Linux <br>
<code>./CozmoCommander.py [--arguments]</code></p>

<p>Arguments: <br>
--help  ... A short description <br>
--viewer=xx ... xx=0 = no viewer (default), 1 = Camera, 2 = 3D, 3 = Camera+3D</p>

CozmoCommander should start without sending error messages to the console, 
the GUI should appear 
and Cozmo should move a few millimeters forward. 

<a name = "How to use CozmoCommander"></a><h2>How to use CozmoCommander:</h2>
The GUI is divided into three frames called "Motion", "Cubes" and "Faces". 
Below these frames there is the bottom section and a status line. 

<!-- ------------------- -->
<a name = "The Motion Frame"></a><h3>The Motion Frame:</h3>

<img src="images\ScreenshotCozmoCommander.jpg">

<p>First you will notice four buttons called "Forward", "Backward", "Left" and "Right". <br>
"Forward" and "Backward" move Cozmo in a straight line, "Left" and "Right" make him turn in place. </p>

<p>The distance and angle by which Cozmo is moved can be entered in the entry fields above. </p>

<p>Below the motion buttons there are sliders to control the head and the lift. <br>
Adjust the sliders and click the buttons above the sliders to move head or lift. </p>

<p>Below the sliders there are three buttons: 
<ul><li>"Map"  ... opens the 2d map, see below. </li>
<li>"Stop" ... Stop all motions</li>
<li>"Play" ... Start or stop freeplay behaviors </li></ul></p>

<!-- ------------------- -->
<a name = "The Cube Frame"></a><h3>The Cube Frame: </h3>
<p>The lightcubes show red or green LEDs indicating whether they are visible to the robot (green) or not (red). <br>
Lightcube 1 shows 1 LED, lightcube 2 shows 2 LEDs and lightcube 3 shows 3 LEDs. </p>

<p>On the Cube frame there are three buttons, indicating the three cubes. <br>
Note that the Id's of the cubes are not necessarily consecuteve. <br>
The buttons turn red or green to indicate whether a cube is visible to the robot. <br>
Click one of these buttons to select a cube for the following actions. <br>
You may select a cube which is not visible. </p>

<p>Buttons for actions are:
<ul><li>"Go To" ... Go near the selected cube, the distance can be adjusted with the slider right of the button. </li>
<li>"Dock"  ... Dock to the selected cube, the angle can be adjusted with the slider right of the button.</li>
<li>"Lift"  ... dock and lift up the selected cube.</li>
<li>"put on top" ... puts a previously lifted cube on top of the selected one. </li>
<li>"roll" ... roll the selected cube. </li></ul></p>

<p>On the bottom of the Cube frame, the coordinates of the selected cube are displayed. </p>

<!-- ------------------- -->
<a name = "The Faces frame"></a><h3>The Faces frame: </h3>
<p>is not yet implemented. </p>

<!-- ------------------- -->
<a name = "The bottom area"><h3>The bottom area:</h3>
<p>A menu lets you choose an animation which is played immediately after selecting it. 
The adjacent button "repeat" will play the previously selected animation again. </p>

<p>A text element lets you enter a text which Cozmo will say when you click the "say" button. </p>

<p>The status line is not yet implemented. </p>

<!-- ------------------- -->
<a name = "The 2D map"></a><h2>The 2D map:</h2>

<img src="images\Screenshot2Dmap.jpg">

<p>When you click the "map" button in the "motion" frame, a separate window is opened. <br>
The map shows coordinate axes with ticks every 100 mm. <br>
Cozmo's location is shown as a black dot. When Cozmo moves, the dot moves and its motion is traced with a line. </p>

<p>A double-click on the map sends Cozmo to the spot where you clicked. </p>

<p>The cubes are shown as little squares (they are not rotated to reflect the rotation angle of the cubes). <br>
The selected cube has a wider border, and the cubes are filled red or green according whether tey are visible or not. </p>

<p>Clicking and dragging creates a "custom object" which is shaped like a wall and which Cozmo will avoid when calculating paths. </p>
